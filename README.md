# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a tic-tac-toe game built using react. This helped me understand how react works and how state forms an important aspect on REACT.



To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
